            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Listen, a map is just a piece of paper with some ink on it until you actually put your boots on the ground. We’ve all seen the generic travel blogs—the "top 10 hidden gems" that aren't actually hidden and the filtered-to-death sunset photos. That's not what this is.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Wanderlog</strong> isn’t just a fancy database; it’s a digital carving on a tree. It’s a middle finger to the idea that we’re just passing through.</p>
                
                <p>The world is massive, ancient, and honestly, it doesn’t care if you show up or not. The mountains will stay there, and the cathedrals will keep crumbling whether you’re looking at them or sitting on your couch. But when you stand in front of a landmark—sweating in the summer heat or shivering in some rain-slicked European alley—something shifts.</p>
                
                <p>You aren't just an "anonymous traveler" anymore. <strong>You’re a witness.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I replaced the "I" in my title with your name because your experience is the only one that matters here. It’s not "I was here." It’s <em>Kinuthia was here</em>. It’s personal. It’s a receipt of existence. You took up space, you breathed that air, and you left a footprint.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s be real: we’re all just collectors of moments. This platform is your vault. It’s a way to look back and say, "Yeah, I saw that. I was there. I felt that." The world is waiting to be stepped on. Go get some dirt on your shoes, come back, and let us know that you were here.</p>
